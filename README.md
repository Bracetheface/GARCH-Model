Volatility Modeling with a GARCH-like Model in Python

Project Objective
This project explores the core principles of financial volatility modeling, a critical component of risk management and derivatives pricing. The goal was to build a model from scratch that captures **volatility clustering**â€”the tendency for high-volatility periods and low-volatility periods to be grouped together in financial time series.

Due to the constraints of a browser-based environment (JupyterLite), this project uses a simplified but powerful GARCH-like model, the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA), to demonstrate these core econometric concepts.

Methodology
1.  **Synthetic Data Generation**: A GARCH(1,1) process was used to generate a realistic financial time series exhibiting volatility clustering. This provided a controlled environment with a known "true" underlying volatility to test the model against.
2.  **Volatility Modeling (EWMA)**: An Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) model was implemented to estimate the conditional volatility of the synthetic returns. The EWMA formula is:
    $$
    \sigma_t^2 = \lambda \sigma_{t-1}^2 + (1-\lambda)r_{t-1}^2
    $$
    This model assumes that today's variance is a weighted average of yesterday's variance and yesterday's squared return (the volatility shock).
3.  **Model Evaluation**: The model's estimated volatility was plotted against the known true volatility of the generated data to visually assess its accuracy and tracking performance.
4.  **Forecasting**: A multi-step forecast was generated to demonstrate how the model projects future volatility, showing its expected reversion to a long-term average.
